  <description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The skeletal system includes all of the bones and joints in the body. Each bone is a complex living organ that is made up of many cells, protein fibers, and minerals. The skeleton acts as a scaffold by providing support and protection for the soft tissues that make up the rest of the body. The skeletal system also provides attachment points for muscles to allow movements at the joints. New blood cells are produced by the red bone marrow inside of our bones. Bones act as the body's warehouse for calcium, iron, and energy in the form of fat. Finally, the skeleton grows throughout childhood and provides a framework for the rest of the body to grow along with it.</description>

  <mainFunction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The adrenal glands are small, triangular-shaped endocrine glands located on top of each kidney. They play a vital role in regulating various physiological processes through the production of hormones. The adrenal glands consist of two main parts: the **cortex** and the **medulla**, each with distinct functions. The cortex produces hormones such as cortisol, which helps regulate metabolism, stress response, and immune function, and aldosterone, which controls blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The medulla produces catecholamines, including adrenaline and noradrenaline, which prepare the body for 'fight or flight' responses by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy availability. Together, these hormones help maintain homeostasis and enable the body to adapt to stress and changing environmental conditions.</mainFunction>
